# Melting and Burning Simulations

### burning.m
Forest Fire percolation simulation in 2D. Barriers are added to stop the spread. Fire currently does not spread further than the nearest 8 squares.

### melting.m
3D Melting simulation 

## forest_gump.m
Non-randomised percolation in 2D. Can be the basis of many interesting projects. Basically just scans the 2D grid row by row performing changes after complete cycle.
